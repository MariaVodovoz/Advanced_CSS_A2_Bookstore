          <p>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel
          written by British author J. K. Rowling. The first novel in the
          Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry
          Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his
          eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to
          Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close
          friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school, and
          with the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by
          the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but
          failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.</p>
           <p>The book was
          first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by
          Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States the following
          year by Scholastic Corporation under the title Harry Potter and
          the Sorcerer's Stone. It won most of the British book awards that
          were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book
          reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction
          in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of
          1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other
          languages, and has been made into a feature-length film of the
          same name, as have all six of its sequels.</p>
           <p>Most reviews were very
          favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple,
          direct style and clever plot construction, although a few
          complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has
          been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite
          authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories
          before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the Ancient Greek
          story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book
          looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school
          stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern
          world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well
          as overcoming obstacles like bullies. Harry Potter and the
          Philosopher's Stone, along with the rest of the Harry Potter
          series, has been attacked by some religious groups and banned in
          some countries because of accusations that the novels promote
          witchcraft under the guise of a heroic, moral story. Other
          religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies
          important viewpoints, including the power of self-sacrifice and
          the ways in which people's decisions shape their personalities.
          The series has been used as a source of object lessons in
          educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.

          <p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</p>
          <p>Orphaned Harry Potter has been living a dog’s life with his horrible relatives. He sleeps in the broom cupboard under the stairs and is treated as a slave by his aunt and uncle. On his eleventh birthday, mysterious missives begin arriving for him, culminating eventually in the arrival of a giant named Hagrid, who has come to escort him to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents died saving him from an evil sorcerer and that he himself is destined to be a wizard of great power. Harry’s astonished introduction to the life of wizardry starts with his purchase, under Hagrid’s guidance, of all the tools of an aspiring sorcerer: wand, robes, cauldron, broomstick, owl. Hogwarts is the typical British public school, with much emphasis placed on games and the honor of the Houses. Harry’s house is Gryffindor, the time-honored rival of Slytherin: he becomes a star at Quidditch, an extremely complicated game played with four different balls while the whole team swoops about on broomsticks. He studies Herbology, the History of Magic, Charms, Potions, the Dark Arts, and other arcane subjects, all the while getting closer to his destiny and the secret of the sorcerer’s stone. He makes friends (and enemies), goes through dangerous and exciting adventures, and justifies the hopeful predictions about him. The light-hearted caper travels through the territory owned by the late Roald Dahl, especially in the treatment of the bad guys — they are uniformly as unshadedly awful as possible — but the tone is a great deal more affectionate. A charming and readable romp with a most sympathetic hero and filled with delightful magic details. ANN A. FLOWERS</p>

       <p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</p>
       <p>In this sequel to the phenomenally popular Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his second year after a miserable summer with his Muggle (nonmagical) relatives. Once again, Harry’s school experiences are colored by encounters with genial ghosts and antagonistic teachers, by the rivalry between good-guy Gryffindor House and slimy Slytherin House, and by an ominous mystery to be solved involving Harry’s archenemy, the dark sorcerer Lord Voldemort. Once again, the attraction of Rowling’s traditional British school story is magnified tenfold by the fantasy elements superimposed upon it. The atmosphere Rowling creates is unique; the story whizzes along; Harry is an unassuming and completely sympathetic hero. But, truth to tell, you may feel as if you’ve read it all before. Rowling clearly hit on a winning formula with the first Harry Potter book; the second book — though still great fun — feels a tad, well, formulaic. MARTHA V. PARRAVANO</p>

       <p>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</p>
       <p>All current reviews of Harry Potter books should probably be addressed to some future audience for whom Harry is book rather than phenomenon; at the moment, reviews seem superfluous. For the record, then, O future reader, this latest installment in Harry’s saga is quite a good book. The basics remain the same: it’s another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (where there’s perforce a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher); it’s still Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Gryffindor House, and the headmaster versus Professor Snape, Draco Malfoy and his Slytherin goons, Lord Voldemort, and various other forces of darkness. But all the elements that make the formula work are heightened here. The characters are particularly interesting, especially the aforementioned new teacher, Professor Lupin, a man with a howling secret; Sirius Black, a feared, possibly mad, escaped prisoner who is believed to have betrayed Harry’s parents and is now said to be after Harry; and Harry himself, who in facing the reality of his parents’ violent deaths becomes a stronger person — and a more complex hero. The Quidditch action is the best yet; the Hogwarts classes (Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, and Potions) are inventive and entertaining; and Rowling pulls off a nifty bit of time manipulation in the book’s exciting climax. There’s hope, too, for a lessening in the power Harry’s Muggle relatives seem to have over him — and so a probability that we won’t have to endure quite so much of these tiresomely one-dimensional characters in the future. Speaking of which . . . have a hot butterbeer, future reader, and enjoy. MARTHA V. PARRAVANO</p>
